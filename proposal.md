## Introduction and diagram for the Video Frame Interpolation project
When we watch movies and TV shows online today, most of them are 24fps format. As most of our screens like monitors or television are 60hz or even 120hz frame rate or more. We will see some common artifacts on the screen if we watch these videos on our screen. The reason for the artifacts occurring is because the low frame rate video will lose moving detail during the movement.

To avoid these common artifacts we want to create a program that is powered by Video Frame Interpolation technology to convert 24fps video to 60fps video. This is a technology that aims to generate non-existent frames in-between the original frames. The usage of this technology can be used not only frame rate up-conversion but also the slow-motion video. 


As you can see in the picture below, the object moves from one frame to the next frame. The model will detect the movement and draw the missing frame and then insert it in-between these two frames. The missing frame is generated by the CNN network with the other two frames as input.

For example, we will use 60fps frames videos to train our model. We use first frames and third frames as input and output a new frame. We will use this new frame to compare with the second frame to accurately model.

## How it is related to Deep Learning for CV ...  - Qiming  

## Steps 
    - research paper 
    - dataset 
    - env/demo (implementation) 
    - results analasys
There are several steps towards making the project. First, We are going to read some related articles and look into previous works on video frame interpolation. We are currently working on bring tradition video coding algorithms into this project, and adapt them into machine learning algorithms. Then, we can decide which approach we are going to take to prediction inter-frame images.  
Second, we need to decide which dataset we are going to use to train and test the neural network. Since we plan to convert lower FPS videos to 60FPS or 90FPS, we need to find some native 60FPS and 90 FPS video or corresponding picture frames.  
In addition, we are going to implement our method and develop a demo for quantitative analysis and class presentation. At this moment, we decide to build the project using Keras library on Ubuntu 18.04.  
Finally, we will run own experiment demo againt exsting project/research, such as Sepconv Slomo. Mstrics including MSE, RMSE, PSNR, and SSIM will be used to quantify the results and evaluate the performance.

## Results and Metrics

### Results:
We use our interpolation model to process the input videos with frame rate 24/25 fps to generate new videos with increased frame rate 60 and 90 fps. And the input videos are from a wide variety of video datasets with different resolutions.

1. Vimeo90K

2. UCF101

3. HD

4. Middlebury dataset
    - results: 24/25 -> 60, -> 90
    - compared with other works  

### Evaluation and Metrics:
To evaluate our interpolation model, the result videos are compared with other methods:

1. ToFlow

2. MDP-Flow2

3. AdaConv

The metrics used for the evaluation consist of quantitative and qualitative comparisons

- Quantitative Comparisons:

  - model parameters
  
  - runtime
  
  - MSE: Mean squared error
  
  - RMSE: Root-mean-square error, the square root of the mean squared error
  
  - PSNR: Peak signal-to-noise ratio, the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise that affects the fidelity of its representation.
  
  - SSIM: Structural similarity (SSIM) index is a method for predicting the perceived quality of various kinds of digital images and video. It is used for measuring the similarity between two images.
- Qualitative Comparisons:
  Visual comparison based the image quality like the clear shape and the restored details.

## Risks

In some cases the results generated by this method contains blocks of noise pixels which appears like artificial spots.
