## Introduction and diagram for the Video Frame Interpolation project
When we watch movies and TV shows online today, most of them are 24fps format. As most of our screens like monitors or television are 60hz or even 120hz frame rate or more. We will see some common artifacts on the screen if we watch these videos on our screen. The reason for the artifacts occurring is because the low frame rate video will lose moving detail during the movement.

In order to avoid these common artifacts we want to create a program which is powered by Video Frame Interpolation technology to convert 24fps video to 60fps video. This is a technology which aims to generate non-existent frames in-between the original frames. The usage of this technology can be used on not only frame rate up conversion but also the slow motion video. 


As you can see in the picture below, the object moves from one frame to the next frame. The model will detect the move and draw the missing frame and then insert it in-between these two frames. The missing frame is generated by the CNN network with the other two frames as input.

For this program, we use 60fps frames videos to train our model. We use 1st frames and 3rd frames as input and output a new frame. We will use this new frame to compare with the 2nd  frame to accurately model.
