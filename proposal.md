## Results and Metrics

**Results:**
We use our interpolation model to process the input videos with frame rate 24/25 fps to generate new videos with increased frame rate 60 and 90 fps. And the input videos are from a wide variety of video datasets with different resolutions.

1. Vimeo90K

2. UCF101

3. HD

4. Middlebury dataset

**Evaluation and Metrics:**
To evaluate our interpolation model, the result videos are compared with other methods:

1. ToFlow

2. MDP-Flow2

3. AdaConv

The metrics used for the evaluation consist of quantitative and qualitative comparisons

- Quantitative Comparisons:

  - model parameters
- runtime
  - MAE: Mean squared error
- RMSE: Root-mean-square error, the square root of the mean squared error
  - PSNR: Peak signal-to-noise ratio, the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise that affects the fidelity of its representation.
- SSIM: Structural similarity (SSIM) index is a method for predicting the perceived quality of various kinds of digital images and video. It is used for measuring the similarity between two images.
  
- Qualitative Comparisons:
  Visual comparison based the image quality like the clear shape and the restored details.

## Risks

In some cases the results generated by this method contains blocks of noise pixels which appears like artificial spots.
