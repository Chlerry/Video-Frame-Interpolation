## How it is related to Deep Learning for CV ...  - Qiming 

With the continuous success of deep learning in the computer field, researchers have tried to combine deep learning with video interpolation technology to meet the needs of coherent video. We design a convolutional neural network to estimate a proper convolutional kernel to synthesize each output pixel in the interpolated images. Our method captures both the motion and interpolation coefficients and uses these kernels to directly convolve with input images to synthesize a middle video frame. Our neural network can be trained end to end using widely available video data, which provides a sufficiently large training dataset.
