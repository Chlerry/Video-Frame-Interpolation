## How it is related to Deep Learning for CV ...  - Qiming 

With the continuous success of deep learning in the computer field, researchers have tried to combine deep learning with video interpolation technology to meet the needs of coherent video. The main advantages of deep learning in video flatform are:
1. Achieving better transformation learning and achieve better results.
2. Learning models can learn on their own, while traditional video compression work requires a lot of manual design.


We design a convolutional neural network to estimate a proper convolutional kernel to synthesize each output pixel in the interpolated images. Our method captures both the motion and interpolation coefficients and uses these kernels to directly convolve with input images to synthesize a middle video frame. Our neural network can be trained using widely available video data, which provides a sufficiently large training dataset.
